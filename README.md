# 🗺️ Dash Maps KDTree Example

This minimal Dash Plotly app uses dash-leaflet to visualize statistical areas in Israel and explore voting patterns. When a user clicks on a statistical area, the app displays other areas in Israel that are closest in terms of voting attributes, utilizing a KDTree for efficient nearest-neighbor searches. A similarity index is shown as a histogram/bar plot, which illustrates how similar the selected area is to other statistical areas, with a line chart showing a scale from 0 (closest) to 1 (furthest).
